-- 1. Insert roles of user_profiles into organization_members

INSERT INTO organization_members (
  org_id, user_id, role, status, joined_at
)
SELECT 
  COALESCE(up.org_id, (SELECT id FROM organizations LIMIT 1)) as org_id,
  up.user_id,

    AND om.org_id = COALESCE(up.org_id, (SELECT id FROM organizations LIMIT 1))
  )
ON CONFLICT (org_id, user_id) DO NOTHING;

-- 2. Update organizations.owner_id (the first 'owner' found for the org)
UPDATE organizations o SET owner_id = (
  SELECT om.user_id FROM organization_members om 
  WHERE om.org_id = o.id 
  AND om.role = 'owner' 
  ORDER BY om.joined_at ASC

)
WHERE o.owner_id IS NULL 
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM organization_members om

-- 3. If an organization still has no owner, assign the first member joined
UPDATE organizations o SET owner_id = (
  SELECT om.user_id FROM organization_members om 
  WHERE om.org_id = o.id 
  ORDER BY om.joined_at ASC 
  LIMIT 1

-- Rollback Procedure:
-- Within the same transaction block, ROLLBACK is automatic if an exception occurs.
-- Manual rollback after commit (DANGEROUS): 
-- DELETE FROM organization_members; 
-- UPDATE organizations SET owner_id = NULL;
