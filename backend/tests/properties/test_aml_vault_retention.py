Property-based test: AML Vault Retention Timestamp Correctness (Property 1)

**Validates: Requirements 3.2**

For any transaction record classified as AML-relevant, storing it in the AML vault
shall produce a record whose `retention_expires_at` equals `created_at + 10 years` exactly.

This test validates the pure logic of the `set_retention_expiry` trigger function
defined in supabase/migrations/071_aml_vault_schema.sql:

    NEW.retention_expires_at := NEW.created_at + interval '10 years';

We replicate this logic in Python and verify it holds for arbitrary timestamps.
